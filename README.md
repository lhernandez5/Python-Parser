# Python-Programming
A Python program that implements a Variant Call Format (VCF) parser as a function that output SNP IDs, reference (REF) and alternative (ALT) alleles, and reference allele frequency (RAF) in the samples. The function is RAF = sum(Nf)/(2*n),  where Nf is the number of samples with reference allele, n is the total number of samples.
