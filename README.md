# Python-Programming
Write a Python program that implements a Variant Call Format (VCF) parser as a function that output SNP IDs, reference (REF) and alternative (ALT) alleles, and reference allele frequency (RAF) in the samples. Your Python script should call the above function by passing a vcf filename (hw5.vcf) and output file (hw6.out) as parameters/arguments to the function.  Note:  RAF = sum(Nf)/(2*n),  where Nf is the number of samples with reference allele, n is the total number of samples.
